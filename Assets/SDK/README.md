# BonerLab SDK
This SDK is based on the extended SDK, but has diverged a lot from it to the point it's kind of it's own thing. It is currently the most complete SDK available, with all the exported scripts available for use.
## SDK Development Flow
MarrowSDK_Ext -> BonerLab Patch 2 -> BonerLab Patch 3 > **BonerLab Patch 4 (current)**
## Things you can make with this fork
- Spawnables, Levels, and Avatars (as usual)  
- Weapons and other objects the require grips  
- Damage Volumes  
- NPCs (Good luck!)
