# BoneLab Lab
Welcome to the BoneLab Lab, this repository is a collection of learning materials for making mods for the aforementioned game, BoneLab.  
  
Where it is possible, example prefabs have been constructed to match as closely as possible to an official StresslevelZero asset; Reference documentation tries to match this philosophy as well.
