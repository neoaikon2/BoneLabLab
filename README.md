# BoneLab Lab
Welcome to the BoneLab Lab, this repository is a collection of learning materials for making mods for the aforementioned game, BoneLab.  
  
Where it is possible, example prefabs have been constructed to match as closely as possible to an official StresslevelZero asset; Reference documentation tries to match this philosophy as well.

# BonerLab SDK
Thie repo is also home to the BonerLab SDK, the most complete BoneLab patch 6 compatible extended SDK available. To use this SDK you need to follow the setup instructions up to the point where you would install the MarrowSDK, and instead of that install [https://github.com/neoaikon2/com.bonerlab.marrow.sdk](https://github.com/neoaikon2/com.bonerlab.marrow.sdk) via git url, afterwards you should be able to copy the contents of the Asset folder in this repository into your own to finish installing it.
