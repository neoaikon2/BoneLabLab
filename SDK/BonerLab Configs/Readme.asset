  - heading: Ammo Groups
    text: Used to define ammo groupings. Light, Medium, and Heavy are defaults. It
      is possible to add new ones but you will need to make a variant of the default
      playe rig and add it to the AmmoInventory, as well as adding UI elements specific
      to the new group. In short, possible but not straightforward at all. It's easier
      to stay within the defined groupings.
