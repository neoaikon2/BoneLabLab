# READ THIS!  
These files are my working copy of the SDK, it is NOT guaranteed to be compatible entirely with Boneworks Patch 2. The files here are updated on an *as-needed basis* **only** for compatibility. If you need an SDK that is entirely compatible with Patch 2 please download from the repository made by [Swipez (Click Here)](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/Marrow-ExtendedSDK-PATCH-2).  
## Things you can make with this copy  
- Spawnables, Levels, and Avatars (as usual)  
- Weapons and other objects the require grips  
- Damage Volumes  
- NPCs (Good luck!)  
##How to Install  
Follow steps 1-5 from the official SDK over at https://github.com/StressLevelZero/MarrowSDK/wiki#project-setup  
  
In step 6, you'll want to import these three packages via github URL:  
  
- https://github.com/StressLevelZero/Custom-RenderPipelineCore.git  
- https://github.com/StressLevelZero/Custom-URP.git#Bonelab  
- https://github.com/Kairus101/MarrowSDKExt.git  
  
Using the green Code dropdown at the top of this page, download a zip of this repositry, and unzip it's contents into your Assets folder to have Assets/Marrow-ExtendedSDK  
  
Continue following steps 7+ from the official SDK documentation.  
## TODO
Add examples for different things?
Museum of Unofficial Interactions? :)
