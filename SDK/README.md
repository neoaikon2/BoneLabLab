# READ THIS!  
These files are my working copy of the SDK, it is NOT guaranteed to be compatible entirely with Boneworks Patch 2. The files here are updated on an *as-needed basis* **only** for compatibility. If you need an SDK that is entirely compatible with Patch 2 please download from the repository made by [Swipez (Click Here)](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/Marrow-ExtendedSDK-PATCH-2).  
## Things you can make with this copy  
- Spawnables, Levels, and Avatars (as usual)  
- Weapons and other objects the require grips  
- Damage Volumes  
- NPCs (Good luck!)  
## TODO
Add examples for different things?
Museum of Unofficial Interactions? :)
